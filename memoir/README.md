In this directory you find various templates using the memoir document
class. A popular class for typesetting assignments, project reports,
theses and even books. It serves as an alternative to the standard
LaTeX classes such as ```article```, ```book```, ```report``` and ```letter```.

If you add a new template to the folder, please add it to the list
below together with a description. You should also commit an
example.pdf, such that people can view an example without installing
all the dependencies.
